# Duple
Duple is a word game for people using a keyboard with an itch to type. Test out your vocabulary and speed
by typing as many words as you can before the timer runs out. But keep in mind, the bigger the word, the bigger the reward.

This is a game for I made for my lovely girlfriend who loves playing puzzle and word games on her phone. Here's yet another one to add to her collection.

*Dear Meli,*

Hi! Recently, you've been pretty into word games and puzzle games, and so for Christmas, I've made you this word game.

I actually came up with this game on the flight back to school after Thanksgiving break finished. While I was in the air, I
had an urge to type a bunch of words and see how many I know. Then I thought about the word game we've been playing together,
and eventually, I had my iPad out and I was writing the goal and rules for this game.

This is my first game for you and I'm very excited for you to play it and give me tons of feedback.

Thanks for being awesome all the time. In return, here's a (hopefully) awesome game. I love you! Enjoy :)
