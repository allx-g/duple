# Duple
Duple is a word game for people using a keyboard with an itch to type. Test out your vocabulary and speed
by typing as many words as you can before the timer runs out. But keep in mind, the bigger the word, the bigger the reward.

### *For Meli:*

Hi Meli. I can tell you like word games a lot, so this Christmas, I've made you one. Since you have that one game that tests
and expands your vocabulary, I wanted to make a game related to that.

I actually came up with this game on the flight back to school after Thanksgiving break finished. While I was in the air, I
had an urge to type a bunch of words and see how many I know. Then I thought about the word game we've been playing together,
and eventually, I had my iPad out and I was writing the goal and rules for this game.

Thanks for being AWESOME. In return, here's a (hopefully) awesome game. I love you! Enjoy :)
